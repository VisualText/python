# Python Class for NLP++

This is a simple class that calls the NLP Engine as a command line executable. This is suitable for tasks that are not meant for production.

If you are wanting to use python to call the NLP++ engine in production mode, please use the NLPPlus Python package in our [NLPPlus Python Package Repository](https://github.com/VisualText/py-package-nlpengine).
